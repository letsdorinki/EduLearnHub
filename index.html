            <p class="bigtext bigtag">Developments of AI in context of digital learning</p>
            <p class="smalltext smalltag">In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, and since then competitors have followed with similar tools which have affected education and learning in several ways. Along with being easily accessible and always available, they are capable of answering specific questions beyond the capabilities of previous search engines, making learning more personalized.[7] Hence, many argue that in some ways interactive tools can contribute positively to overall learning.[8] On the other hand, critics claim it may lead to an overreliance on AI, since students may be tempted to rely solely on
                 the answers of AI, rather than applying their own critical thinking.Additionally, the quality of the information provided by AI chatbots has been criticized. AI has been shown to vary in answer reliability, which highlights the need to verify
                  information obtained through such platforms.[9]

            <p class="bigtext bigtag">Pedagogies that incorporate digital learning</p>
            <p class="smalltext smalltag">Digital learning has many beneficial outcomes, one of which is the studentâ€™s ability to work at his/her own pace. With assignments being online students can decide when they want to complete them. If they work best in the morning, they can do them in the morning. On the other hand, if they work best in the evening, they can complete the assignments in the evening. Without having the stress and time limitations of being in a classroom, they can take as long or as little time as they need.
                 This allows them to understand the concept and retain the knowledge fully.Digital learning offers many environmental benefits. Online education relies strictly on digital documents, therefore reducing paper waste and the amount of trees cut down. Studies show that using ebooks as opposed to traditional textbooks would
                  save more than 28,000 trees per million books.
